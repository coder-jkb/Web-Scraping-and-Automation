# Web-Scraping-and-Automation
This is a small project in which I have worked with Selenium and Chrome Drivers to automate a small task.

# Task to automate
1. Take First name and Last name from user
2. Open browser and visit this link: https://cybertext.wordpress.com/2007/04/30/fake-names-for-documentation/
3. Seacrh if there are exact matches for first name and/or last name and assign credits accordingly
4. Display the result in the console of the website

# Techstack
1. `Chrome driver` and `Selenium` in `python 3` for automation
2. `Tkinter` for a GUI

# Installation
## To install Selenium for Python 
   run `pip install selenium` in the terminal
## Chrome Driver needs to be downloaded based on your browser version
1. Open Chrome browser in the desktop
2. Open Settings in Chrome
3. Click on About Chrome and check your version

## NOTE: Once you download the chrome browser unzip the file and save the `chromedriver.exe` file in the same directory whrere your code is.
